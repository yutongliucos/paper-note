## Targeted protein degradation
- The Challenge of Targeted Protein Degradation:

### 1.Designed endocytosis-inducing proteins degrade targets and amplify signals
:innocent: author:Buwei Huang, Mohamad Abedi
#### 1.1 Content
- diffenert stragies for designing binders to target the recepter which can be orthogonal to native ligand, induce conformation change and oligomerization.
#### 1.2 Design Strategies

#### 1.3 Method

- structure can be refined using FastRelsx and them using longxingcao'generate pipline.
- design two binder infusion using linker or rigid structure.
